While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo Go and the Android emulator. The app would build successfully, but when attempting to run it on the emulator, I'd receive an error indicating that the app couldn't connect or find the necessary resources. This happened inconsistently, sometimes working and sometimes failing without any apparent changes in the code.
