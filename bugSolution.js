The issue was intermittent and didn't have a single, consistent cause.  However, these steps helped mitigate the problem:

1. **Network Connectivity:** Verify that both your development machine and the Android emulator are connected to the same network.  Emulator network settings often need to be explicitly set to use the host machine's network.
2. **Restart:** Restarting the Android emulator, your development machine, and in some cases, the Expo Go app on your phone helped resolve temporary connection issues.
3. **Emulator Configuration:** Double check the emulator's configuration to ensure that network access is enabled and configured correctly.
4. **Expo CLI Updates:** Make sure your Expo CLI is up to date using `expo upgrade`.
5. **Check Firewall:** Check your firewall settings to confirm that there are no restrictions on the ports used by Expo Go.

If the problem persists, provide detailed logs and network configurations for more specific troubleshooting.
